    <h1>Machines in Physics</h1>

    <h2>1. Mechanical Advantage (MA)</h2>
    <p>Mechanical Advantage is the ratio of the output force (load) to the input force (effort) in a machine.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>MA = <sup>Load (L)</sup> / <sub>Effort (E)</sub></p>

    <h2>2. Velocity Ratio (VR)</h2>
    <p>Velocity Ratio is the ratio of the distance moved by the effort to the distance moved by the load in a machine.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>VR = <sup>Distance moved by Effort (d<sub>e</sub>)</sup> / <sub>Distance moved by Load (d<sub>l</sub>)</sub></p>

    <h2>3. Efficiency (η)</h2>
    <p>Efficiency of a machine is the ratio of the useful work output to the work input, usually expressed as a percentage.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>η = (<sup>Work output</sup> / <sub>Work input</sub>) × 100%</p>
    <p>Since work output is equal to load times load distance and work input is equal to effort times effort distance, efficiency can also be expressed as:</p>
    <p>η = (<sup>MA</sup> / <sub>VR</sub>) × 100%</p>

    <h2>4. Work Input</h2>
    <p>Work input is the work done on a machine, calculated as the product of the effort and the distance moved by the effort.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>Work Input = Effort (E) × Distance moved by Effort (d<sub>e</sub>)</p>

    <h2>5. Work Output</h2>
    <p>Work output is the work done by a machine, calculated as the product of the load and the distance moved by the load.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>Work Output = Load (L) × Distance moved by Load (d<sub>l</sub>)</p>

    <h2>6. Law of the Lever</h2>
    <p>In a lever, the moments about the fulcrum are equal for equilibrium.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>Effort (E) × Effort Arm (d<sub>e</sub>) = Load (L) × Load Arm (d<sub>l</sub>)</p>

    <h2>7. Types of Simple Machines</h2>
    <p>The most common types of simple machines include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lever</li>
        <li>Inclined Plane</li>
        <li>Wheel and Axle</li>
        <li>Pulley</li>
        <li>Screw</li>
        <li>Wedge</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Inclined Plane</h2>
    <p>An inclined plane reduces the effort needed to lift a load by increasing the distance over which the effort is applied.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>VR = <sup>Length of Incline (L)</sup> / <sub>Height of Incline (h)</sub></p>

    <h2>9. Pulley System</h2>
    <p>In a pulley system, the velocity ratio is equal to the number of strands of the rope supporting the load.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>VR = Number of supporting strands</p>

    <h2>10. Screw</h2>
    <p>A screw converts rotational motion into linear motion.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>VR = <sup>Circumference of Screw</sup> / <sub>Pitch of Screw</sub></p>
